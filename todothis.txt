Problem 1: Pending Pets
Images are in D:\Petpostedimages\ but frontend tries to load from regular /images/ URL.
Fix: Use /images/pending/ URL instead!
Problem 2: Adoption Requests
The adoption_requests table probably doesn't have the pet's image stored in the pet_image column. It's NULL or empty!
Fix: Copy image from pets table to adoption_requests table.

🚀 Quick Fix Steps:
Step 1: Run Diagnosis (2 min)
Run IMAGE_DIAGNOSIS.sql in MySQL to see exactly what's wrong:

What columns exist
What image paths are stored
If pet_image is NULL

Step 2: Fix WebConfig.java (3 min)
Make sure it serves images from BOTH folders:
java// PENDING images
registry.addResourceHandler("/images/pending/**")
        .addResourceLocations("file:D:/Petpostedimages/");

// APPROVED images
registry.addResourceHandler("/images/**")
        .addResourceLocations("file:D:/Adoptionpetimages/");
Step 3: Fix Database (1 min)
Copy pet images to adoption requests:
sqlUPDATE adoption_requests ar
JOIN pets p ON ar.pet_id = p.pet_id
SET ar.pet_image = p.image_url
WHERE ar.pet_image IS NULL OR ar.pet_image = '';
Step 4: Fix Frontend URLs (2 min)
PendingPetsAdmin.jsx:
javascriptsrc={`${API_URL}/images/pending/${pet.imagePath}`}
AdoptingRequests.jsx:
javascriptsrc={`${API_URL}/images/${req.petImage}`}
